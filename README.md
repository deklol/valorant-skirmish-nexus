## üèÅ Tournament Lifecycle

Our tournaments progress through distinct, well-defined stages, each managed by automated systems and real-time updates:

1. **Draft:** The initial phase where tournament administrators configure rules, game modes, and participant limits.  
2. **Open:** Player registration active. Participants can sign up, form teams, and prepare for the event.  
3. **Balancing:** A critical automated phase where teams are intelligently created or rebalanced based on our proprietary rank weighting system to ensure competitive fairness.  
4. **Live:** Matches are in progress. Scores, match statuses, and bracket progressions are updated in real-time.  
5. **Completed:** The tournament has concluded, winners are determined, final statistics are recorded, and historical data is archived.

## üèÜ Bracket Generation Logic

At the heart of our tournament system is a sophisticated bracket generation and management engine:

- **Algorithm:** `calculateBracketStructure()`  
  - Dynamically generates optimal single-elimination bracket structures.  
  - Intelligently handles various participant counts, including non-power-of-2 numbers, by implementing appropriate byes.  
  - Ensures fair seeding based on player ranks or other defined criteria.  
- **Progression:** Automated match advancement. As soon as a match result is confirmed, the winning team/player is automatically moved to the next round, updating the bracket in real-time.  
- **Validation:** Real-time bracket health monitoring continuously checks for structural integrity, potential errors, and ensures smooth progression, flagging any anomalies proactively.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Rank Weight System & Team Balancing

| Rank       | Points       | Description               |
|------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Iron 1-3   | 10 - 20 pts  | Entry-level players       |
| Bronze 1-3 | 20 - 40 pts  | Developing players        |
| Silver 1-3 | 40 - 70 pts  | Intermediate players      |
| Gold 1-3   | 70 - 90 pts  | Above average players     |
| Platinum 1-3 | 90 - 120 pts | Skilled players         |
| Diamond 1-3 | 120 - 180 pts | Mid skilled players     |
| Ascendant+ | 180 - 300 pts | High players             |
| Immortal+  | 300 - 500 pts | Top-tier players         |

- **Ranking Algorithm:** `rankingSystemWithOverrides()`  
  - Calculates an effective player rank by combining multiple data points:  
    - **Base Rank:** The player's primary competitive rank.  
    - **Peak Rank:** Accounts for a player's highest achieved rank to prevent "smurfing" or sandbagging.  
    - **Manual Overrides:** Allows administrators to make fine-tuned adjustments for specific player circumstances or known skill levels not reflected by automated data.  
- **Team Balancing:** `TeamBalancingLogic.generateTeams()`  
  - Utilizes an iterative optimization algorithm to distribute players across teams.  
  - The primary goal is to minimize the rank variance (or skill differential) between all participating teams, ensuring that matches are as balanced and exciting as possible.

## üó∫Ô∏è Veto Flow (Best-of-1)

Our interactive map veto system provides strategic depth for best-of-1 matches:

1. Home team bans map: The first team removes a map from the pool.  
2. Away team bans map: The second team removes another map.  
3. Away team bans map: The second team removes a third map.  
4. Home team bans map: The first team removes a fourth map.  
5. Away team bans map: The second team removes a fifth map.  
6. Home team bans map: The first team removes a sixth map.  
7. Map is auto-picked: The final remaining map is automatically selected for play.  
8. Home team chooses side: The home team then selects their starting side (e.g., Attack/Defense).  

This process is reflected in real-time within the user interface, allowing captains to make informed decisions.

## üé≤ Cryptographically Secure Dice Rolling

For fair and transparent in-game decisions (e.g., tie-breakers, side selection where not vetoed), we implement a cryptographically secure dice rolling mechanism:

- **Secure Randomness:** Leverages the browser's native `window.crypto.getRandomValues()` API, which provides high-quality, unpredictable random numbers suitable for cryptographic purposes.  
- **Verifiable Seed:** Each roll's seed is generated by combining:  
  - A precise timestamp for temporal uniqueness.  
  - The user ID of the initiator for accountability.  
  - Additional cryptographic random data from `getRandomValues()`.  
- **Transparency:** All dice rolls, along with their full contextual data (seed, participants, outcome), are meticulously logged in the `audit_logs` database table, maintaining complete transparency and verifiability for all events.

## üóÑÔ∏è Core Database Tables

Our Supabase PostgreSQL database schema is structured to efficiently manage all tournament-related data:

- `tournaments`: Stores details about each tournament (status, dates, rules).  
- `teams`: Manages team information (names, logos, current roster).  
- `matches`: Records individual match data (teams, scores, status, associated tournament).  
- `users`: User profiles and authentication details.  
- `team_members`: Junction table linking users to teams.  
- `map_veto_sessions`: Tracks the state of ongoing map veto processes.  
- `map_veto_actions`: Logs each ban/pick action within a veto session.  
- `maps`: Reference data for available game maps.  
- `match_maps`: Links matches to specific maps played.  
- `audit_logs`: Comprehensive log of critical system actions and user interactions (including dice rolls).  
- `notifications`: Stores user notifications.  
- `user_notification_preferences`: User-specific settings for notification delivery.  
- `vods`: Stores video-on-demand (VOD) links and metadata for past matches/tournaments.

## üîí Security & Access Control

Security is paramount. Our platform implements robust measures to protect data and ensure authorized access:

- **Row Level Security (RLS):** Implemented across all critical database tables. This ensures that:  
  - Users can only access or modify data they explicitly own (e.g., their profile, their team's data).  
  - Public data is accessible to all, while sensitive data is restricted.  
  - Administrators have elevated privileges where necessary, strictly controlled.  
- **Supabase Authentication:** Handles secure user registration, login, and session management.  
- **Audit Trails:** Comprehensive audit logs are maintained for all critical actions, providing a clear, immutable record of who did what and when, crucial for transparency and debugging.

## ‚ö° Real-Time Features

Leveraging PostgreSQL's NOTIFY/LISTEN capabilities via Supabase real-time subscriptions, we provide an engaging, live experience:

- **Live Matches:** Instantaneous propagation of score updates, match status changes, and player actions to all connected clients.  
- **Veto Actions:** Real-time display of map bans and picks as they occur during the veto phase.  
- **Team Changes:** Immediate updates when team rosters are modified or players join/leave.  
- **Notifications:** Push real-time notifications to users about match starts, results, and other relevant events.

## ü©∫ Health Monitoring & Emergency Tools

To ensure continuous operation and rapid response to issues, we have integrated proactive monitoring and recovery tools:

- **BracketHealthAnalyzer:** A dedicated system that continuously monitors the integrity and progression of tournament brackets in real time, flagging any inconsistencies or stalled matches.  
- **TournamentHealthDashboard:** Provides administrators with a high-level overview of all active tournaments, highlighting potential issues, performance metrics, and critical alerts.  
- **Emergency Reset:** A controlled mechanism allowing safe rollback of a tournament to a previous stable state in case of critical errors, with all actions meticulously recorded in the `audit_logs`.  
- **Team Reconstruction:** Advanced tools to facilitate the re-assignment of players and rebalancing of teams in complex scenarios (e.g., player dropouts, unforeseen imbalances), minimizing disruption to ongoing events.
